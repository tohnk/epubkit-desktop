# epubkit

A web-based EPUB optimizer for e-ink readers. Drop in any EPUB and get back a clean, optimized file ready for your device.

Originally built for the [Xteink X4](https://xteink.com/) (480x800 portrait e-ink display, 4-level grayscale, SSD1677 controller, ESP32-C3). Now also supports the smaller [Xteink X3](https://www.xteink.com/products/xteink-x3) (528x792 display, same controller) via a device toggle, and works with any Xteink reader or e-ink device that supports EPUB.

## Processing pipeline

epubkit runs this pipeline on every EPUB:

| Step | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| 1 | **DRM check** — detects DRM-protected files and stops early with a clear message |
| 2 | **Extract** — unpacks the EPUB ZIP structure into a working directory |
| 3 | **Parse structure** — locates the OPF package file and parses the manifest |
| 4 | **Read metadata** — extracts title, author, series, language, cover reference |
| 5 | **Apply metadata edits** — overwrites title/author if the user edited them in the UI |
| 6 | **Find content files** — catalogs all XHTML, CSS, image, and font files in the EPUB |
| 7 | **Process images** — converts all images to baseline JPEG, resizes to the device screen (480x800 for X4, 528x792 for X3; max 1024x1024), applies 4-level grayscale quantization with Floyd-Steinberg dithering, autocontrast histogram stretching, and contrast boost. Light Novel mode rotates/splits landscape images |
| 8 | **Fix SVG covers** — unwraps SVG-wrapped cover images (common in Gutenberg/store EPUBs) |
| 10 | **Update references** — rewrites all internal hrefs and srcs to match renamed image files |
| 11 | **Repair HTML + strip attributes** — fixes malformed XHTML with lxml recovery parser, strips unnecessary attributes (data-\*, aria-\*, role, tabindex, etc.) to reduce parsing overhead for the 380KB RAM device |
| 12 | **Remove unused CSS** — collects all used classes/IDs/elements across XHTML files, then strips CSS rules that don't match anything |
| 13 | **Remove embedded fonts** — deletes @font-face rules from CSS, removes font files (.ttf, .otf, .woff, .woff2), and cleans them from the OPF manifest |
| 14 | **Normalize whitespace** — strips excessive empty paragraphs/divs, adds CSS page-break-before to chapter headings (h1, h2) |
| 15 | **Text cleanup** — scans all text nodes (skipping script/style/pre/code) and fixes: double spaces, OCR ligature artifacts (fi/fl/ffi/ffl/ff), smart quotes → straight quotes, mojibake encoding errors, punctuation issues, Unicode NFC normalization |
| 16 | **Clean metadata** — strips store-specific tags (Calibre, iBooks, Kindle, Amazon, Google Play, Kobo) |
| 17 | **Fix TOC** — validates the Table of Contents, generates one from chapter headings if missing |
| 18 | **Clean OS artifacts** — removes .DS_Store, Thumbs.db, __MACOSX, desktop.ini, etc. |
| 19 | **Repackage** — rebuilds the EPUB ZIP with correct mimetype entry and deflate compression |
| 20 | **Output filename** — generates a clean `Author - Title.epub` filename from metadata |

## Usage

```sh
# the desktop app
cargo run -p epubkit-desktop

# or the command line
cargo build --release

# optimize a book; the output is named from its metadata
./target/release/epubkit optimize book.epub

# pick a device and a preset
./target/release/epubkit optimize book.epub --device x3 --preset quick

# inspect a book without changing it
./target/release/epubkit info book.epub
```

Your choices are remembered between runs, so an option you turn off stays off.
`epubkit settings show` prints the current state, and `epubkit settings save
"My X4"` keeps it as a named preset.

Building needs libxml2's headers (`apt-get install libxml2-dev` on Debian and
Ubuntu; macOS has one in the SDK).

## Processing presets

| Preset | Images | Text | Fonts | CSS | Cover | Metadata | Best for |
|--------|--------|------|-------|-----|-------|----------|----------|
| Quick  | Yes    | Yes  | No    | No  | No    | No       | Fast image + text pass |
| Full   | Yes    | Yes  | Yes   | Yes | Yes   | Yes      | Complete device optimization |
| Custom | Pick   | Pick | Pick  | Pick| Pick  | Pick     | Fine-grained control |

The device toggle (X4/X3) works independently of the preset — it controls image dimensions and grayscale depth.

## Device specs

The optimizer is tuned for these hardware constraints:

| Spec | X4 | X3 |
|------|----|----|
| Display | 480x800 portrait (4.3" panel) | 528x792 portrait (3.7" panel) |
| Grayscale | 4 levels (SSD1677): black, dark gray, light gray, white | Same 4-level SSD1677 hardware |
| Processor | ESP32-C3, 160MHz | ESP32-C3 |
| RAM | 380KB usable | 380KB usable |
| Max image | 1024x1024 pixels | 1024x1024 pixels |
| Formats | EPUB, XTC, XTCH, Markdown, TXT | EPUB, TXT |
| Storage | 32GB + microSD | 16GB microSD |

Image fit boxes match the [CrossPoint reference converter](https://github.com/crosspoint-reader/crosspoint-reader) device profiles (X4: 480x800, X3: 528x792). The panels scan in landscape, but the readers display portrait — images sized to the portrait box render sharp without reader-side upscaling.

Note: stock Xteink firmware (X3 and X4 alike) does not render images inside EPUBs at all — hardware-verified on both devices with unmodified store EPUBs and a diagnostic EPUB covering 8 encoding variants (JPEG parameter permutations, PNG, BMP); every image page renders blank while text renders normally. Image optimization therefore benefits custom firmware such as [CrossPoint](https://github.com/crosspoint-reader/crosspoint-reader)/CrossInk, which renders 4-level grayscale images on both panels.

## Image processing details

- **Format**: All images converted to baseline JPEG (progressive breaks many e-ink readers)
- **Resize**: Fit within the device screen (480x800 X4, 528x792 X3, portrait), hard clamp at 1024x1024
- **Grayscale**: 4-level quantization matching the SSD1677 palette (0, 85, 170, 255) with Floyd-Steinberg dithering (both devices)
- **Contrast**: Auto-histogram stretching (`ImageOps.autocontrast`) followed by 1.5x contrast boost
- **Subsampling**: 4:2:0 for grayscale (all RGB channels identical, saves ~15-20%), 4:4:4 for color
- **Transparency**: Alpha composited onto white background
- **Light Novel mode**: Landscape images rotated 90°; double-page spreads (aspect > 1.8) split into two portrait pages

## Text cleanup details

Scans all XHTML text nodes (skipping `<script>`, `<style>`, `<pre>`, `<code>`):

- **Whitespace**: Multiple spaces/tabs → single space, removes spaces before punctuation
- **OCR ligatures**: fi (U+FB01), fl (U+FB02), ffi (U+FB03), ffl (U+FB04), ff (U+FB00) → plain ASCII
- **Smart quotes**: Typographic quotes/dashes → straight equivalents (configurable)
- **Mojibake**: Detects and repairs common UTF-8/Latin-1 double-encoding patterns
- **Punctuation**: 4+ dots → ellipsis, missing space after sentence-ending punctuation, duplicate commas
- **Unicode**: NFC normalization

## Tech stack

Rust, as a library plus a CLI, with a desktop front-end to follow.

- **[libxml2](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2)** — XML/XHTML parsing and repair, via the `libxml` crate
- **[image](https://crates.io/crates/image)** — decoding and Lanczos resampling
- **[lightningcss](https://lightningcss.dev/)** — CSS parsing and cleanup
- **[zip](https://crates.io/crates/zip)** — EPUB container handling

This began as a Python/FastAPI web app. The port is described in
[PORTING.md](PORTING.md), which also records where the Rust deliberately
behaves differently from the original. The Python implementation lives on in
git history at `7cf9a65` if you need to compare against it:

```sh
git show 7cf9a65:epub_processor.py
```

## DRM note

epubkit cannot process DRM-protected EPUBs. It will detect DRM and let you know. You'll need to remove DRM first using tools like [DeDRM](https://github.com/noDRM/DeDRM_tools) with Calibre.

## About

Built by [@b1rdmania](https://github.com/b1rdmania). Made because existing tools required too many steps — Calibre plugins, CLI scripts, manual image conversion. epubkit does it all in one pass through a simple web interface.
